# RL-Xid

This repository contains the code for all available versions of RL-Xid.
RL-Xid is an automated process which cross-identifies extended extragalactic 
radio sources with their optical counterparts using the innovative method of 
ridgelines.  The background and details of this process are described in my 
paper:
